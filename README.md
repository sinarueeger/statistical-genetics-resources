# Resources for Statistical Genetics

This repository lists resources needed for GWAS and statistical genetics.

The content is mainly aimed for people starting in the field of statistical genetics. 

There are four lists:

- Publicly available [genetic data](statgen-data.md) (raw or summarized).
- [Readings](statgen-reading.md), mostly research articles.
- [Software](statgen-software.md) to perform statistical analyses on genetic data.
- [Learning](statgen-learning.md) material.

## Getting started

Podcast about [GWAS](https://everythinghertz.com/85) (_GWAS big teeth you have, grandmother_) by [Everything Hertz](https://everythinghertz.com/) (with [Kevin Mitchell](https://twitter.com/WiringTheBrain)).

High-level [GWAS introduction](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/gwas-catalog-exploring-snp-trait-associations-2019/what-gwas-catalog/what-are-genome-wide) by GWAS catalogue.


## Contribute
 
I have started this collection while working on [my PhD thesis](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/FpWZlbw4Rfq20le) and hope it can be extended continuously.

If you would like to contribute to any of these lists, please make a pull request or file an [issue](https://github.com/sinarueeger/statistical-genetics-ressources/issues).
